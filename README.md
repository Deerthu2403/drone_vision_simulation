# drone_vision_simulation
Created a Python-based simulation of the drone's vision using OpenCV to detect and track objects in real time. Developed an image processing and motion detection algorithm in Python to simulate drone camera vision to demonstrate expertise in computer vision, object tracking, and AI-based visual analysis.
